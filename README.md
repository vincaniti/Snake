# Snake

The legendary snake game coded in javascript !

I used several classes to manage the game. 
A class for the blocks, one for the snake and one for the food. 
A large class manages the game and the infinite loop until the player is defeated

When a block is eaten, so that the head of the snake is on the block, 
it disappears, a block is added to the tail of the snake and a new block of food appears.

The snake can cross walls and the player loses when the head meets a tail block

Good game !
